## Classroom game system
### Description of the system requirements
The system is a classroom game designed to enhance learning in data structures and algorithms. 
It involves three decks of cards: unanswered questions, answered questions, and discarded cards. 
Each player takes turns answering questions, which yield scores. 
Correct answers to unanswered questions earn full points, while correct answers to discarded questions earn 80% of the points. 
Players can accept or decline questions, and the game tracks their performance over three rounds. 
A hierarchical chart displays the top 30 winners, and a detailed leaderboard shows scores and question details, helping identify strong and weak areas for students.

### Developpment Tools
The system will be developed in Microsoft Visual Studio (2022 version or newer) and using C++ language.
### Retrictions
Built-in containers such as <list>, <vector>, etc. are not allowed in this assignment.
All containers are self-created.
